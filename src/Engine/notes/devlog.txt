11:19 PM 1/4/2026; so you know how i made 3 force types? yeah so i deleted one of them. the "Walk" one. instead i just decided that changing the position RAW in walk() is fine. well news flash: sometimes you need to access the speed of your object and the way i'm doing this right now doesn't update the speed. this is a problem for tomorrow me. fuck this i'm gonna go play something.
